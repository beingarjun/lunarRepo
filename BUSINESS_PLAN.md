# 🌕 lunarRepo - Complete Business Plan

**LUNAR** = **L**ocal-first **U**niversal **N**ative **A**udit-ready **R**epository and task orchestration

## Executive Summary

lunarRepo is an open-source, local-first build orchestration and task execution platform designed for enterprise teams. While Moonrepo builds tooling for multi-project codebases and monorepo automation with cloud-first infrastructure, lunarRepo provides deterministic builds, immutable audit trails, and complete governance without vendor lock-in or cloud dependency.

**Market Opportunity:** $12.8B serviceable addressable market
**First Year Revenue Target:** $280K ARR (6 customers)
**Year 3 Projection:** $8.5M ARR (52 customers)

## Problem Statement

### Current State of Build Orchestration
- **Wasted Time:** Teams spend 15+ hours/week optimizing builds and cache invalidation
- **Observability Gap:** 70% of build failures lack adequate diagnostic information
- **Compliance Risk:** No immutable audit trails for regulated industries
- **Vendor Lock-In:** Proprietary cloud solutions from moonrepo, Nx cost $30K-$500K/year

### Target Pain Points
1. **Build Performance** - Slow monorepo builds causing developer frustration
2. **Cost Overhead** - Expensive CI/CD infrastructure and build caching solutions
3. **Governance Gaps** - Missing audit trails and compliance features
